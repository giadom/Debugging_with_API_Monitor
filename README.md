# Topic of this guide
The technique illustrated in this guide (and oriented for Windows) allows to debug a sample (i.e. an instance of a malware) using **also** _API Monitor_ (by Rohitab).  
To use this technique you just need:
- your favourite debugger;
- API Monitor.
I will not explain in detail the functioning of this latter tool (for which I kindly redirect you to <http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor>), but by the way I will explain something about it.
