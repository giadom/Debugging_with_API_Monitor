# Topic of this guide
The technique illustrated in this guide is oriented **for Windows** and allows to debug a sample (i.e. an instance of a malware) using **also** _API Monitor_ (by Rohitab).  
This technique has sped up my malware analysis on several occasion and to use it you just need:
- your favourite debugger;
- `API Monitor`.

I will not explain in detail the functioning of this latter tool (for which I kindly redirect you to <http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor>), but by the way I will explain something about it.

# Table of contents

- "Guide" you will find the tutorial for this technique.
